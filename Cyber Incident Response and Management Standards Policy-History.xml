<LBody>Caregiver: PeaceHealth employee, volunteer, trainee, and other persons whose conduct, in the performance of work for PeaceHealth, is under the direct control of PeaceHealth, regardless of whether they are paid by PeaceHealth. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Covered person: Includes caregivers, non-employed medical directors, locum tenens and relief providers, members of the Board of PeaceHealth and committees with Board-delegated powers, members of the Community (Network) Board of Directors, members of the Foundation Board of Directors, PeaceHealth representatives of PeaceHealth Joint Ventures or partially or wholly owned PeaceHealth subsidiaries, volunteers, trainees and medical students, any others designated by PeaceHealth's Board or leadership, contracted providers, medical staff members, officers, Board Members, and Directors of Affiliated Organizations, joint ventures, or partially or wholly owned PeaceHealth subsidiaries. </LBody>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_200">POLICY </H2>

<P>PeaceHealth will protect the organization's information, as well as its reputation, by developing and implementing an incident response infrastructure (e.g., plans, defined roles, training, communications, management oversight) for quickly discovering an attack and then effectively containing the damage, eradicating the attacker's presence, and restoring the integrity of the network and systems. </P>

<P>This is achieved by PeaceHealth implementing the following security controls: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>Document Incident Response Procedures. Ensure that there are written cyber incident response plans that define roles of personnel as well as phases of cyber incident handling/management. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>Assign Job Titles and Duties for Incident Response. Assign job titles and duties for handling computer and network incidents to specific individuals and ensure tracking and documentation throughout the incident through resolution. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>Designate Management Personnel to Support Incident Handling. Designate management personnel, as well as backups, who will support the cyber incident handling process by acting in key decision-making roles. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>4. </Lbl>

<LBody>Devise Organization-Wide Standards for Reporting Incidents. Devise organization-wide standards for the time required for system administrators and other workforce members to report anomalous events to the incident handling team, the mechanisms for such reporting, and the kind of information that should be included in the incident notification. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>5. </Lbl>

<LBody>Maintain Contact Information for Reporting Security Incidents.

</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>6. </Lbl>

<LBody>Publish Information Regarding Reporting Computer Anomalies and Incidents. Publish information for all covered persons, regarding reporting computer anomalies and incidents, to the incident handling team. Such information should be included in routine employee awareness activities. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>7. </Lbl>

<LBody>Conduct Periodic Incident Scenario Sessions for Personnel. Plan and conduct routine incident response exercises and scenarios for the workforce involved in the incident response to maintain awareness and comfort in responding to real-world threats. Exercises should test communication channels, decision making, and incident responder's technical capabilities using tools and data available to them. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>8. </Lbl>

<LBody>Create Incident Scoring and Prioritization Schema. Create cyber incident scoring and prioritization schema based on known or potential impact to your organization. Utilize score to define frequency of status updates and escalation procedure. </LBody>
