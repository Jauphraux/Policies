<H2 id="LinkTarget_216">PURPOSE </H2>

<P>The purpose of this policy is to establish requirements for account management to aid in protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PeaceHealth's information systems. </P>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_218">DEFINITIONS </H2>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Auto logon accounts: Those accounts that are set up on some shared workstations to automatically log on to the local workstation with a Generic Account without user intervention when the computer is started. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Caregiver: PeaceHealth employee, volunteer, trainee, and other persons whose conduct, in the performance of work for PeaceHealth, is under the direct control of PeaceHealth, whether or not they are paid by PeaceHealth. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Generic accounts: Accounts that are not associated with a specific person. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Principle of least privilege (PoLP): The practice of limiting access to the minimal level that will allow the user to perform his or her assigned duties and functions. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Privileged accounts: Privileged accounts are accounts that have been granted elevated permissions to information resources. Privileged accounts typically can bypass, modify, or disable technical security controls and have broad access to confidential information. Examples of privileged account users include system administrators and database administrators. Accounts created explicitly to run applications or processes, known as service accounts, may also be privileged accounts. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Protected health information (PHI): Individually identifiable health information relating to past, present, or future physical or mental health conditions, provision of health care, or payment for healthcare, which is created/received by a provider, plan, employer or clearinghouse, in any medium (written, electronic, or verbal). Protected health information excludes individually identifiable health information: 
<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>◦ </Lbl>

<LBody>In education records covered by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>

</LI>
</L>
</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Role-based access control (RBAC): A method of regulating access to computer or network resources based on the roles of individual users within the PeaceHealth organization. A role is essentially a collection of permissions, and all users receive permissions only through the roles to which they are assigned, or through roles they inherit through the role hierarchy. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Standard user account: Account used for day-to-day activities such as accessing email and internet browsing. Standard account users can use most software and change system settings that do not affect other users. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>User: Caregivers, providers, volunteers, students, and third parties who access PeaceHealth information systems. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>User identification (user ID): A logical entity used to identify a user on a software, system, website, or within any generic IT environment. It is used within any IT enabled system to identify and distinguish between the users who access or use it. A user ID may also be termed as Username or user identifier. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_272">POLICY </H2>

<P>It is the policy of PeaceHealth that the following requirements are implemented to support account management for PeaceHealth information systems that process, store, or transmit confidential information: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>PeaceHealth will support the following types of information system accounts: 
<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>a. </Lbl>

<LBody>Individual user account; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>b. </Lbl>

<LBody>Built-in / default accounts provided by the manufacturer of the device, operating system, or application; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>c. </Lbl>

<LBody>Service accounts for system processes or scheduled system tasks; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>d. </Lbl>

<LBody>Test accounts for use in non-production environments; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>e. </Lbl>

<LBody>Training accounts for use in training environments; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>f. </Lbl>

<LBody>Emergency accounts for use in authorized &quot;break the glass&quot; situations in patient care area; and </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>g. </Lbl>

<LBody>Auto logon accounts used on shared workstations in patient care areas. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>
</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>Each account will have an assigned account manager. For a user account, the account manager will be the user's supervisor; for a non-user account, the account manager will be the resource owner (e.g., application owner, system administrator). Account managers are responsible for the following: 
<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>a. </Lbl>

<LBody>Validating that users have received adequate training in proper utilization of PeaceHealth information systems prior to use; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>b. </Lbl>

<LBody>Validating that accounts for access to PeaceHealth information systems are set up, maintained, and terminated appropriately; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>c. </Lbl>

<LBody>Reviewing account access levels on a periodic basis, no less than annually, to maintain consistency with minimum necessary, need-to-know principles, and to ensure that accounts that are no longer required are de-provisioned; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>d. </Lbl>

<LBody>Providing timely notification to the TSP Service Desk when a user's responsibilities change, a user transfers to a different position or department, a user departs on extended leave of absence, or when a user terminates employment, their contract ends, etc.; and </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>e. </Lbl>

<LBody>Verifying that all requirements are met to reinstate the user's access to information systems, as necessary, prior to the user's return to work, for users who are returning to work after a significant absence. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>
</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>Conditions for group and role membership are as follows: 
<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>a. </Lbl>

<LBody>Each information system account will be assigned to a group and/or a role that grants that user specific permissions on the information system; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>b. </Lbl>

<LBody>Group and role membership for user accounts will be granted based on the user's position and job responsibilities; and </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>c. </Lbl>

<LBody>Group and role membership for non-user accounts (e.g., service accounts) will be assigned based on the purpose of the account. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>
</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>4. </Lbl>

<LBody>Only authorized users may request information system accounts, and only authorized users may approve information system accounts. The account requestor must be different than the account approver. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>5. </Lbl>

<LBody>Account login attempts, both successful and unsuccessful, to systems that process, store, or transmit confidential information, will be logged such that discrepancies can be identified. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>6. </Lbl>

<LBody>An individual user account, also known as a standard user account, is the account assigned to an individual that will be a user of the information system. 
<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>a. </Lbl>

<LBody>Each user of a given PeaceHealth information system is assigned a unique individual user account which enables them to access PeaceHealth information systems based on their job role. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>b. </Lbl>

<LBody>Only individuals with a clear business or clinical need will be granted access to PeaceHealth information systems. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>c. </Lbl>

<LBody>Users whose job roles require elevated permissions to PeaceHealth information systems are granted an additional unique user account that is managed through a privileged access management system. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>d. </Lbl>

<LBody>To be granted access to PeaceHealth information systems, prospective users must provide personal data required for identification and user account setup. The data required is dependent upon the type of user and is outlined in Identity and Access Management (IAM) procedures. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>e. </Lbl>

<LBody>All prospective users, PeaceHealth employed as well as third party, must sign a confidentiality agreement. Some exceptions apply and are documented in the IAM procedures. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>f. </Lbl>

<LBody>User account status is monitored, and accounts are disabled after a period of inactivity in accordance with Identity and Access Management (IAM) procedures. 
<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>i. </Lbl>

<LBody>Users may request reactivation of accounts via the TSP service desk. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>
</LBody>
</LI>
</L>
</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>7. </Lbl>

<LBody>A generic account is a user account that is not associated with an individual user. Because generic accounts lack the accountability and non-repudiation features of an account that is assigned to an individual, their use must be tightly regulated. The following restrictions apply to generic accounts: 
<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>a. </Lbl>

<LBody>Permission assignments for generic accounts use role-based access controls (RBAC) and the principle of least privilege; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>b. </Lbl>

<LBody>Generic accounts are not used for the administration of PeaceHealth systems unless specifically authorized via the exceptions process; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>c. </Lbl>

<LBody>Generic accounts are never used to access any electronic health record (EHR) or clinical support application that contains protected health information (PHI) or to access PHI that may occur elsewhere on PeaceHealth systems; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>d. </Lbl>

<LBody>Each Caregiver who uses a shared workstation that is set up with an auto logon account must use his/her own unique logon to access the EHR or any other application that has or may have access to PHI. Users will follow the current procedures to log on and log off the system with their own unique logon; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>e. </Lbl>

<LBody>Users may never use a generic account in lieu of their standard user account; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>f. </Lbl>

<LBody>PHI may never be saved to the local computer using a shared workstation that uses an auto logon account; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>g. </Lbl>

<LBody>Generic accounts do not have access to the internet unless specifically authorized through the exception process. For example, a service account may be authorized to download patches from a vendor site; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>h. </Lbl>

<LBody>Generic accounts do not have access to email unless specifically authorized through the exception process. For example, a service account may be authorized to sends alerts via email; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>i. </Lbl>

<LBody>Generic accounts are controlled and authorized in the event of an emergency. This is supported by authorized individuals in order to eliminate any single point of failure; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>j. </Lbl>

<LBody>Generic accounts must have a strong, unique password. Passwords for generic accounts must be safeguarded; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>k. </Lbl>

<LBody>Generic accounts may never be shared or provided for multiple user access unless specifically authorized through the exception process; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>l. </Lbl>

<LBody>No person or entity not employed by PeaceHealth may have a generic account; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>m. </Lbl>

<LBody>Generic accounts must follow PeaceHealth naming conventions and be appropriately designated in Active Directory (AD); </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>n. </Lbl>

<LBody>Generic accounts must be de-provisioned when they are no longer needed; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>o. </Lbl>

<LBody>Generic accounts must be reviewed by the resource owner no less frequently than annually to ensure accounts that are no longer necessary are de-provisioned; and </LBody>
</LI>
