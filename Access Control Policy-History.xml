<H2 id="LinkTarget_220">PURPOSE </H2>

<P>The purpose of this policy is to establish requirements for access control to aid in protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PeaceHealth's information systems. </P>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_222">DEFINITIONS </H2>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Caregiver: PeaceHealth employee, volunteer, trainee, and other persons whose conduct, in the performance of work for PeaceHealth, is under the direct control of PeaceHealth, regardless of whether they are paid by PeaceHealth. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Confidential Information: Information related to patients, caregivers, or providers, PeaceHealth proprietary information, other information related to PeaceHealth business, and any other information that is protected by law is to be considered strictly confidential unless specified otherwise. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>External information systems: External information systems are information systems outside PeaceHealth control and include, for example, personally owned devices and information systems owned and controlled by other organizations. Additionally, external information systems include cloud systems used for processing, storage, or transmission of PeaceHealth information. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Information System: A discrete set of information resources organized for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information (FIPS 200). </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>Least privilege: Least privilege is the principle that persons or processes be granted the minimum level of permissions required to do their jobs or to perform their intended function. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>• </Lbl>

<LBody>User: Caregivers, providers, volunteers, students, and third parties who access PeaceHealth information systems. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_248">POLICY </H2>

<P>It is the policy of PeaceHealth that the following requirements are implemented to support access control for PeaceHealth information systems that process, store, or transmit confidential information: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>1. </Lbl>

<LBody>PeaceHealth implements account management for the information system in accordance with the Account Management policy. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>2. </Lbl>

<LBody>Information systems enforce approved authorizations for logical access to information and system resources in accordance with applicable access control policies. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>3. </Lbl>

<LBody>Information systems enforce approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information within the system and between interconnected systems in accordance with the Information Flow Enforcement Policy. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>4. </Lbl>

<LBody>When not technically infeasible, conflicting duties and areas of responsibility will be separated to reduce the opportunities for unauthorized or unintentional modification or misuse of PeaceHealth's resources. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>5. </Lbl>

<LBody>PeaceHealth applies the principle of least privilege (PoLP) for access to information systems, which allows the minimum privileges necessary to accomplish assigned work. For users whose job roles require elevated privileges, a dedicated privileged access account is created. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>6. </Lbl>

<LBody>PeaceHealth information systems are configured to enforce a limit to the number of consecutive logon attempts within a defined period of time. When the maximum number of unsuccessful logon attempts is reached, then the account will be locked to further attempts. The duration of the account lockout is until the account is released by an administrator or the expiration of the account lockout period. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>7. </Lbl>

<LBody>A logon banner will be displayed when individuals log on to PeaceHealth information systems and until the user acknowledges the message by taking explicit action. The logon banner will have, at a minimum, the following notices: 
<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>a. </Lbl>

<LBody>Users are accessing a private information system and access is for authorized users only; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>b. </Lbl>

<LBody>Unauthorized use is prohibited and subject to administrative, civil, and/or criminal penalties; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>c. </Lbl>

<LBody>The information system may be monitored, recorded, and subject to audit; and </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>d. </Lbl>

<LBody>Use of the system indicates consent to monitoring and recording. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>
</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>8. </Lbl>

<LBody>PeaceHealth information systems limit the number of concurrent sessions for each user. Specific limits may differ for different types of accounts (e.g., non-privileged user, privileged user, domain, specific application). The limits are selected due to system attributes, such as available licenses, system resources, and security requirements. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>9. </Lbl>

<LBody>PeaceHealth information systems initiate a session lock to prevent further access to the system after a defined period of inactivity or by request from the user. The information system retains the session lock until the user reauthenticates. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>10. </Lbl>

<LBody>PeaceHealth information systems may terminate user sessions under certain conditions as defined by the system owner. For example, systems with limited licenses may terminate user sessions after a period of inactivity. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>11. </Lbl>

<LBody>Only authorized users and devices may connect remotely to PeaceHealth information systems. Remote access to PeaceHealth information systems adheres to usage restrictions, configuration/connection requirements, and implementation guidance in accordance with the PeaceHealth Remote Access Policy. </LBody>

</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>13. </Lbl>

<LBody>Only authorized mobile devices may connect to PeaceHealth information systems. Mobile devices that are connected to PeaceHealth information systems are subject to usage restrictions, configuration requirements, connection requirements, and implementation guidance in accordance with the PeaceHealth Mobile Device Policy. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>14. </Lbl>

<LBody>The use of external information systems to process, store, or transmit PeaceHealth information are subject to PeaceHealth terms and conditions as stated in a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) or other contractual arrangement and include assurances of appropriate information security controls at the external organization. The following requirements apply: 
<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>a. </Lbl>

<LBody>Storage of PeaceHealth data on personal devices is prohibited; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>b. </Lbl>

<LBody>Physical connection of personally owned devices to PeaceHealth resources is prohibited; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>c. </Lbl>

<LBody>Access to internet sites, portals (e.g., payor portals, government sites), or cloud services that are used to support PeaceHealth business are only used in accordance with established agreements (e.g., BAA); and </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>d. </Lbl>

<LBody>Connection to or from an external organization (e.g., via Citrix, site-to-site VPN) is only permitted with BAA or other contractual arrangement. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>
</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>15. </Lbl>

<LBody>Sharing of protected information between organizations is sometimes necessary in the support of patient care or other PeaceHealth business. Sharing of protected health information (PHI) is done in accordance with the Relationships with Other Entities Involving Protected Health Information Policy, 900.1.156. </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>16. </Lbl>

<LBody>Posting of PeaceHealth information to publicly accessible information systems must adhere to the following requirements: 
<L>
<LI>
<Lbl>a. </Lbl>

<LBody>Only authorized individuals may post information onto publicly accessible information systems; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>b. </Lbl>

<LBody>Authorized individuals will be trained to ensure that nonpublic information is not included with public information and that nonpublic information is not posted to publicly accessible information systems; </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>c. </Lbl>

<LBody>Information that will be posted to publicly accessible information systems will be reviewed by at least one additional authorized individual to ensure no nonpublic information is included; and </LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<Lbl>d. </Lbl>

<LBody>The content on publicly accessible sites will be reviewed regularly for nonpublic information; any nonpublic information that is discovered will be removed and the event will be documented using the incident reporting process. </LBody>
</LI>
</L>
</LBody>
</LI>
</L>
